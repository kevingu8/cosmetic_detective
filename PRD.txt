Product Requirements Document (PRD)

Project: Cosmetic Detective (维鉴-style authenticity verification)
Owner: Kevin Gu
Version: Draft v0.1 (Week-0)

1. Problem Statement

Cosmetic buyers often doubt the authenticity of their purchases, especially from online and cross-border markets. Current solutions (forums, vague guides, vendor promises) are inconsistent and unreliable. Users want a fast, trustworthy, mobile-first way to verify authenticity with human expertise.

2. Users & Roles

End Users (Consumers): upload photos of cosmetics, submit tickets, receive verified results.

Reviewers (Part-time Workers): claim tickets, inspect photos, provide verdicts and rationale, chat with users if clarification is needed.

Admins: manage assignments, monitor SLAs, resolve disputes, and oversee reviewer performance.

3. Core Job-to-Be-Done

“When I’m unsure if a cosmetic is genuine, I want to upload photos and receive a clear, human-verified answer quickly, so I can shop with confidence.”

4. Features (MoSCoW Prioritization)
Must-Have (MVP)

User authentication (login/logout).

Submit ticket: upload 1–5 photos + brand/category/notes.

Ticket list & detail view with live status timeline.

Reviewer console: claim ticket, view photos, provide verdict, submit result.

Result delivery to user (authentic / inauthentic / undetermined + rationale).

Basic chat between user and reviewer.

Push notifications for status changes.

Secure storage and access control (users only see their tickets).

Should-Have (Post-MVP)

SLA timers and auto-reassign for idle tickets.

Reviewer canned responses/templates.
